 What is Software testing?
 -- identify the quality and correctness of the Software

 How many ways can we test a software?
 1. MANUAL
 2. AUTOMATION

 When do we go for automation?
 -- frequesnt regression  testing is required
 -- repeated test case execution
 -- efficiency

 What are the tools that we have for automation?
 Selenium, UFT/QTP, Cucumber, TestNG, KAtlon Studio

 Level of Testing:
 1. Unit testing
 2. Integration Testing
 3. System testing
 4. Acceptance testing

 Type of Testing:
 1. functional testing
 2. non functional testing(performance, security)

 what is Selenium?:
 -- A set of tools that help us to automate
 web based application only
 it is usually used for performance Testing

 Selenium suit:
 1. Selenium IDE - it is basicly a plugin, record and play.
 cons: no programming

 2. Selenium RC (remote control) :
 * supports different programming languages
 * supports different browsers
 * it is required a rc server

 3. Selenium Webdriver:
 a) support different browsers
 b) it will support different languages

 4. Selenium Grid:
 1) consist of a node and hub
 2) run test cases in parellel on different browsers

 Selenium 1:
 Selenium 2 --> Selenium 2--> Selenium RC and webdriver  (combined)
 Selenium 3 --> some improvements in Selenium 2
 Selenium 4 --> some changes and improvments in the communication protocols

 Advantages of Selenium:
 -- Open Source
 -- Completible with different language(java, ruby, c#)
 -- It allows you to have your test cases run on different browsers (firefox, opera, chrome, etc)
 -- it is not OS dependent( windows, MAc, linux)

Disadvantage of Selenium:
-- no technical support
-- we can not test desktop application
-- no built in reports
-- can not test captachas, images and videos

Selenium Architector

driver.close()--> it will close the current tab that we are on
driver.quit() --> it will close whole browser

get() vs navigate()
-- using navigate we can move forward, backward and refresh the page
but using get we can not do that

-- all webpages are made of usually HTML, CSS,and js
we have tags in hTML
1.tags have different purpose i.e. to define headings, pragrahps, picture, etc
** we must have a opening and a closing tag
<html>
</html>
example how is html works:
<batch11>
<listofstudents>
<name>sorbon</name>
<name>hasim</name>
</listofstudent>
<instructors>
<name>moazzam</name>
<name>asghar</name>
</instructors>
</batch11>
