What is a drop Down?

1.Single Select-->one option
2.multiple select-->more then one

Two methods to handle drop downs:
1.Click on the drop Down and then Select the option
2.Use Select Class
Condition:
<select> tag is there in the drop down

Select class is a class available to us in seleinium which has
different methods that help us to handle the drop downs

Steps to use select class:

1.to find the webElement "dropdown" having the select class
2.Create an object of Select class(webElement(which has the select tag))
3.Use any method provided by Select class to select the option you desire
    a.  .Byvalue() -->parameters  the value attribute  "value" in <options> tag
    b.  .Byindex() -->parameter   the index of the option that you want to select
    c.  .ByVisibleText() -->parameter the text in the tag <option> which we want to select

4. .getOptions()--> no parameter returns us all the tags <options> which are child of <select tag>
return type is <list>WebElements



Multiple select drop down

1. isMultiple()--> if the drop dwon is multiselect or not
additonal methods:

a. deselectbyindex()
b. deslectbyvalue()
c. deselectbyvisibletext();
d. deslectAll()
exception :
No such element exception --> the Webelement you are looking for is not there on the page


Alerts:
a popup message,it takes the focus completely off the page
We cannot proceed in selenium until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:

1.webabsed alerts --> it is an html based alert / we can resolve them simply by insepecting ( like sign up in FB,
то есть главная сайта как фон и сплывает и новое окошко открывается)
2.Javascript Alerts/browser alerts --> we can handle them by insepcting? NO (because they donot have html),
we handle them using  switchTo method in selenium

3.Windows based alerts: cannot handle with selenium



Javascript Alerts:
3 Types
1.Simple Alert --> click ok
2.Confirmation Alert --> either cancel or ok
3.Promp Alert -->enter text and cancel or ok


HOW TO HANDLE THESE JAVASCRIPT ALERTS IN SLENIUM
USING "alert interface"

The methods it gives us:
1.accept()
2.dimsiss()
3.getText()
4.sendKeys()
