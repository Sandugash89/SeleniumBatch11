DropDowns
Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or
multiple options

Types of dropdowns:
1. Single select
2. Multiple select

Handling dropdowns:
1. click on dropdown and click on the option
2. using Select class
            in order to use Select class
            we need to make sure our dropdown has
            select tag

Selecting an option from dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value
